    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to our blogging platform — a space built for creators, thinkers, and
      storytellers.<br /><br />

      We believe writing should be seamless and expressive, so we created a
      platform where you can write your blogs in Markdown — the lightweight,
      intuitive syntax that makes formatting a breeze — and instantly see your
      content transformed into beautiful, structured HTML.<br /><br />

      Our intuitive text editor features a live preview pane, allowing you to
      focus on your words while watching your blog take shape in real time. No
      more switching tabs or guessing how your content will look — what you see is
      what you get.<br /><br />

      Whether you're a seasoned writer, a developer documenting your journey, or
      someone just beginning to explore the world of blogging, our platform gives
      you the tools to publish with clarity and confidence.<br /><br />

      Your words matter. We`re here to help you share them with the world —
      cleanly, clearly, and beautifully.
